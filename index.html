			<h5> Welcome to Winnie's wonderland ! </h5>
			<h4> Our history </h4>
			<p> Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood, among ancient trees and wildflowers, lies the secret of the most delightful honey. For as long anyone can remember, Winnie the Pooh, the bear with an endless love for honey, has roamed every corner of the forest in search of the perfect nectar. 
			With help of his friends, Pooh has found the finest flowers, where bees happily buzz and gather the richest nectar. Each jar of honey is the result of this quest, crafted with love and care by the bees under Pooh's watchful eye. When you taste Winnie the Pooh's honey, you're savoring a little bit of magic and sweetness from the forest itself. 
			A sugary treasure to share, perfect for little and honey lovers alike ! </p>
